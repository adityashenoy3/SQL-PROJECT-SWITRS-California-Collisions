# California Traffic Collision Analysis Project

## Overview
This project conducts an in-depth analysis of traffic collision data in California, sourced from the Statewide Integrated Traffic Records System (SWITRS). The data spans from January 1, 2001, to June 3, 2021, and offers a comprehensive look at various aspects of road accidents in the state.

## Data Source
- **Database URL**: [Kaggle - California Traffic Collision Data from SWITRS](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alexgude/california-traffic-collision-data-from-switrs)
- **Data Dictionary**: [SWITRS Help - TIMS](https://tims.berkeley.edu/help/SWITRS.php)

## Project Description
The aim of this project is to extract meaningful insights from the SWITRS dataset. This includes analyzing collision trends over years, identifying common causes of accidents, examining the role of alcohol in collisions, and understanding the distribution of collision types and their outcomes. Specific SQL queries are used to delve into various facets of the data, such as:
- Yearly collision counts
- Average number of victims per collision
- Influence of alcohol and road conditions on collision severity
- Distribution of collisions across different vehicle types and jurisdictions

## Key Inquiries
Some of the pivotal questions addressed in this project include:
- Are motorcyclists predominantly responsible for accidents?
- Is there a correlation between certain days of the week and the prevalence of DUI-related collisions?
- How do vehicle makes and models correlate with collision frequency and severity?
